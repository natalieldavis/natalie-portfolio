**Client:** Ellis & Co. Australia 

**Role:** Creative Director 

**Project Scope:** Brand identity, website design, online store, social media campaigns, product photography

**Project Goal:** Create a brand suite that reflects the family history behind Ellis & Co. and the elegance and classic style of their luxury accessories.

Ellis & Co. was more than just a brand; it was a family story, woven into every thread of their luxury accessories. As a creative director, I was tasked with bringing this rich heritage to life, transforming it into a visual language that resonated with discerning customers.

**Creating a Timeless Brand**

Inspired by their legacy, I set out to create a brand identity that was both classic and contemporary. The logo, a carefully crafted monogram, was a nod to their family history, while its sleek design exuded modern elegance. The colour palette, a harmonious blend of neutrals and blush tones, reflected the sophistication and luxury of their products.

**Building a Digital Presence**

The Ellis & Co. website was more than just a digital storefront; it was a curated experience. Each page was designed to tell a story, inviting visitors to immerse themselves in the world of the brand. High-quality product photography showcased the intricate details and impeccable craftsmanship of their accessories.

**Connecting with Customers**

Social media campaigns brought the brand to life, sharing behind-the-scenes glimpses into the creative process and connecting with a community of like-minded individuals. Through carefully curated content and engaging storytelling, we built a strong online presence that reflected the brand's values.
